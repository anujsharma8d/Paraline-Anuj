# Audio Helper Development

Paraline uses a native C# audio helper for loopback/system audio capture.

If you're working on audio bridge functionality:

## Build the Helper

```bash
dotnet build ./audio-helper/Paraline.AudioBridge.csproj
```

Or use:

```bash
npm run build:helper
```

# Pull Request Guidelines

## Keep PRs Focused

Good:

* Fix a specific bug
* Improve one feature
* Refactor a single system
* Improve error handling

Avoid:

* Large unrelated rewrites
* Massive formatting-only changes
* Multiple unrelated features in one PR

---

# Code Style

## General Principles

* Keep code readable and simple
* Prefer clarity over cleverness
* Avoid unnecessary dependencies
* Keep functions focused on one responsibility

## JavaScript

* Use consistent formatting
* Prefer descriptive variable names
* Avoid deeply nested logic where possible

---

# Error Handling

Paraline should fail gracefully whenever possible.

When adding error handling:

* Prefer user-friendly messages
* Include actionable troubleshooting hints
* Avoid exposing unnecessary internal details
* Preserve useful debug information for developers

Example:

Instead of:

```js
"Helper failed."
```

Prefer:

```js
"Audio capture helper failed to start.

Troubleshooting:
- Try restarting Paraline
- Ensure the helper binary exists
- Rebuild the helper if needed"
```

# Notifications & UX

Please avoid:

* Notification spam
* Repetitive modal dialogs
* Excessively noisy logs

User-facing behavior should feel lightweight and non-intrusive.
